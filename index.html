    <p> Haha, nope. I appreciate your curiosity, and I'm certain if you dig, you can find a great deal of information me. I'm no ghost. I'm not going to contribute to that any more than I need to, though. Everything I want to share about myself online is here in my work. If you're my friend, we'll get to know each other.</p>
