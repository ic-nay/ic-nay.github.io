          <p> Like a lot of people, I experimented a bit in university. Unfortunately, I fell in with the wrong crowd, and got hooked on trivia. I mainly write Quizbowl, though I might throw in a bit of Consensus, or whatever else takes me (click to expand).</p>

      <p> I'm aware these aren't particularly good. But, more than anything, writing is something I love doing, and being able to share it is very motivating. I'm more than happy to fail out loud. </p>
